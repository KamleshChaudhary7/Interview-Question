1) What is Class?
Answer: A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Classes encapsulate data and behavior, providing a template for object creation and manipulation. It defines a new data types.
- Class keyword is used to declared a class.

2) What is Object?
Answer: An object in Java is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods). Objects encapsulate data and behavior, allowing them to interact with other objects and perform actions based on their defined behavior.

3) What is Instance Variable and Instance Method or Class Members?
Answer: The Data and Method declared within a class is called Instance Variable and Instance Method also known as Class Members.

4) What is Parameter and Argruments?
Answer: Parameters are variables declared in a method signature. which receive a value when method is called. It's local to method don't have scope outside method.
Arguments are the values passed to a method during a method call.

5) What is Constructor and Type of it?
Answer: A constructor in Java is a special type of method that is automatically called when an instance of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the newly created object and set its initial state.

There are several types of constructors in Java:
Default Constructor: If a class does not explicitly define any constructors, Java provides a default constructor automatically. It initializes instance variables to their default values (e.g., null for reference types, 0 for numeric types, false for boolean).
Example:
public class MyClass {
    // Default constructor provided by Java
}

Parameterized Constructor: A constructor with parameters allows you to specify initial values for the instance variables of an object at the time of its creation.
Example:
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    
    // Parameterized constructor
    public Car(String make, String model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
    }
}

Copy Constructor: A copy constructor accepts an object of the same class as a parameter and initializes a new object by copying the values of the instance variables from existing object.
Example:
public class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    
    // Copy constructor
    public Point(Point other) {
        this.x = other.x;
        this.y = other.y;
    }
}
--> A copy constructor in Java can be implemented using either shallow copy or deep copy.

Chained Constructor (or Constructor Overloading): In Java, constructors can call other constructors within the same class using the this() keyword. This allows for constructor overloading and helps in reducing code duplication.
Example:
public class Rectangle {
    private int length;
    private int width;
    
    // Chained constructors
    public Rectangle() {
        this(0, 0); // Call parameterized constructor
    }
    
    public Rectangle(int length, int width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }
}

6) Copy Constructor vs Clone
Answer: 
Copy Constructor:
1) No interface implementation required.
2) Offers flexibility for implementing custom copy logic, including deep or shallow copy.
3) Allows direct assignment to final fields in the copied object.
4) Provides precise control over copying behavior.

clone() Method:
1) Requires implementing the Cloneable interface.
2) Limited to shallow copy by default, must override for deep copy.
3) Cannot directly modify final fields in the cloned object.
4) Provides built-in support for cloning, but less flexible for custom logic.

7)  What are the main pillars of OOPs Concepts? Explain the OOPS Concepts?
Answer :
Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) into a single unit (object).
Technical Implementation: Bean class is an example of Encapsulation. We declare properties as private and provide public getter and setter methods for each variable.
Real Life Example: Capsule is the perfect example of encapsulation. The capsule has different types of small tablets inside a wrapper. 

Inheritance: Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
Technical Implementation: You can implement inheritance using extends and implementation keywords. If you are extending another class then you have to use extends keyword and If you implement the interface then you have to use the implement keyword.
Real-Life Example: Say suppose your grandfather has agricultural land, farmhouse and your father has flat, some gold and shares and you have racer bike, iPhone and laptop. Ultimately whatever property your grandfathers have will be inherited to your dad and your dad’s property inherited to you. But remember reverse is not possible. 


Polymorphism: The ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors /  one name different form.
An entity can have different behaviour in different situations. 
Technical Implementation: Polymorphism can be implemented by using Method overloading and method overriding.
Real-Life Example: A person can have a different role at a time with a different location or context. The person can be a father in the home, the person can be a manager in the company, Person can be a dancer in the movie. 

Abstraction: Abstraction means hiding the implementation. 
Technical Implementation: Abstract class and Interface implements the abstraction. An abstract class is partial abstraction because abstract class can have concrete methods as well as abstract methods and the interface is full abstraction because the interface contained only abstract methods, not concrete methods.

8) How does an interface maintain full abstraction even after the introduction of default methods, private methods, and static methods in Java 8?
Answer : Interfaces in Java achieve full abstraction despite the inclusion of default methods, private methods, and static methods introduced in Java 8. Default methods provide optional implementations, private methods are hidden from implementing classes, and static methods are utility methods unrelated to instance behavior, ensuring that interfaces still abstract away implementation details while providing additional flexibility and utility.

9) What is Method Overloading?
Answer: Two or more methods with the same name in a class, but with different parameters like must be differ in type or no. of parameters. overloaded methods can have different access modifiers.
Method overloading demonstrates compile-time polymorphism, also known as static polymorphism. This is because the decision on which overloaded method to call is made by the compiler at compile time, based on the method signature.

10) What is Method Overriding?
Answer: When a method in a subclass has the same name, parameter list, and return type as a method in its superclass, it is said to override the superclass method. 
Method overriding is a form of runtime polymorphism, also known as dynamic polymorphism, because the method to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.

Method overriding in Java has limitations:
- Access modifier must be same or less restrictive.
- Final, Static and Private methods cannot be overridden.
- Expection Rules:
  1) If SuperClass does not declare an exception, then the SubClass can only declare unchecked exceptions, but not the checked exceptions.
  2) If SuperClass declares an exception, then the SubClass can only declare the same or child exceptions of the exception declared by the SuperClass and any new Runtime Exceptions,     
     just not any new checked exceptions at the same level or higher.
  3) If SuperClass declares an exception, then the SubClass can declare without exception.

We can also change the return type of method for overriden method after JAVA 5.

11) Dynamic Method Dispatch?
Answer: Dynamic method dispatch is a mechanism where the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object being referenced, rather than the reference type.

When a method is invoked on an object using a reference variable, the JVM checks the reference type (the declared type of the reference variable) to determine which method to invoke.
If the method is overridden in a subclass, the JVM checks the actual type of the object (the type of the object that the reference variable is pointing to) to determine which implementation of the method to execute.

12) Garbage Collection
Answer: Garbage collection is process to releasing unused memory occupied by unused Object. JVM automatically reclaims memory occupied by unused objects. It uses algorithms like mark and sweep to identify and reclaim memory.

The most common garbage collection algorithm used in Java is the mark and sweep algorithm. 
This algorithm involves two phases:
Marking phase: The garbage collector traverses all reachable objects starting from a set of root objects (such as objects referenced by threads, static variables, and local variables) and marks them as reachable.
Sweeping phase: The garbage collector scans the entire heap and reclaims memory from objects that are not marked as reachable (i.e., garbage).

Objects in Java become eligible for garbage collection when there is no refrence to an object. This can happen when references are set to null, go out of scope, or are reassigned. also annonymous object using anonymous class.

You can request the garbage collector to run using the System.gc() method. However, it's important to note that calling System.gc() only suggests to the JVM that it's a good time to run the garbage collector, but it doesn't guarantee that the garbage collector will actually run immediately.
The decision to run the garbage collector ultimately lies with the JVM, and it may choose to ignore the request for various reasons such as system load, memory pressure, or internal optimization strategies.

13) Finalize() Method 
Answer: The finalize() method in Java is used for cleanup actions before an object memory is reclaimed by the garbage collector. It's deprecated since Java 9 due to uncertainty in its invocation timing and performance impact. It's not recommended for critical resource cleanup, and alternatives like try-with-resources are preferred.

14) this Keyword
Answer: The this keyword in Java refers to the current object instance. It's used to access instance variables, invoke methods, invoke current class constructor, constructor channing and differentiate between instance variables and local variable with the same name. It cannot be used in a static context. Also used in synchronized block to lock the particular object.

15) final Keyword
Answer: 
Variable: Declares a constant variable that cannot be reassigned. If it's not initialized at the point of declaration, it must be initialized in constructors of the class.
Method: Prevents method overriding by subclasses.
Class: Prevents class inheritance, making the class final and unable to be subclassed.

16) Static Keyword 
Answer: The static keyword in Java is mainly used for memory management. The static keyword in Java is used to share the same variable or method of a given class. The users can apply static keywords with variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class. The static keyword is used for a constant variable or a method that is the same for every instance of a class.
- Static variables : When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and shared among all objects at the class level. static block and static variables are executed in the order they are present in a program.
- Static methods : When a method is declared with the static keyword, it is known as the static method
  Restriction : They can only directly call other static methods. They can only directly access static data. They cannot refer to this or super in any way.
- Static blocks : in order to initialize your static variables, you can declare a static block that gets executed exactly once, when the class is first loaded. It's called before constructor.

Static Final Blank variable : If it's not initialized at the point of declaration, it must be initialized in static block of the class.

17) Static Binding vs Dynamic Binding
Static Binding (Early Binding):
Also known as compile-time binding or early binding.
The determination of which method to call is done at compile time based on the reference type (or declared type) of the object.
Static binding occurs for methods that are private, final, static, or static methods called with the class name.
The main advantage of static binding is performance because the method resolution is done at compile time, which is faster.
Example: Method calls to private, final, or static methods.

Dynamic Binding (Late Binding):
Also known as runtime binding or late binding.
The determination of which method to call is done at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
Dynamic binding occurs for non-private, non-final, and non-static methods.
Dynamic binding allows for polymorphic behavior, where the same method call may produce different results depending on the actual type of the object.
The main advantage of dynamic binding is flexibility because the method resolution is deferred until runtime, allowing for method overriding and polymorphism.
Example: Method calls to overridden methods in subclasses.

18) What is Inheritance and Type of Inheritence.
Answer: Inheritance in Java allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class. inherites all non-private member including fields and methods. IS_A Relationship.
Beneficts : Code Resuability, Polymorphism Allowed by Method Overriding.
Drawback : Tightly Coupled - Because any change in the SuperClass it will also affect all the child class.

There are different types of inheritance:
Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from only one superclass. 
Multiple Inheritance: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes, but it supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inherits from another subclass, that also inherite another class.
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.

In Java, single inheritance for classes and multiple inheritance through interfaces are supported.

19) Why doesn't Java allow multiple inheritance through classes? 
Answer : Multiple Inheritance is not supported to remove ambiguity and to provide more maintainable and clear design. 
Ambiguity around the Diamond problem, consider a class A has foo() method and then B and C derived from A and has their own foo() implementation, and now class D derives from B and C using multiple inheritance and if we refer just foo() compiler will not be able to decide which foo() it should invoke. This is called as the Diamond problem.

Another reason multiple inheritances does complicate the design and creates problem during casting, constructor chaining etc and given that there are not many scenarios on which you need multiple inheritances its wise decision to omit it for the sake of simplicity. 
1) Multiple inheritance can create problems during casting because of the potential for ambiguity in determining the correct superclass from which to cast. 
Example:  In this example, when we attempt to cast child to Parent1 and call method1(), there's ambiguity about whether method1() should be called from Parent1 directly or through Child. This ambiguity is a source of confusion and potential runtime errors.
class Parent1 {
    void method1() {
        System.out.println("Parent1 method");
    }
}

class Parent2 {
    void method2() {
        System.out.println("Parent2 method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent1, Parent2 {
    // Child class methods and attributes
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
        ((Parent1) child).method1(); // Which method1() to call?
    }
}
2) Multiple inheritance can create problems during constructor chaining when a class inherits from multiple superclasses, each with its own constructor. This can lead to ambiguity about which superclass constructor should be called first and how constructor arguments should be passed.
Example: In this example, the Child class needs to call constructors from both Parent1 and Parent2. However, since Java does not support multiple inheritance through classes, it's unclear which superclass constructor should be called first in the Child constructor.
class Parent1 {
    Parent1() {
        System.out.println("Parent1 constructor");
    }
}

class Parent2 {
    Parent2() {
        System.out.println("Parent2 constructor");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent1, Parent2 {
    Child() {
        // Which superclass constructor to call first?
    }
}

20) Super Keyword
Answer: The super keyword in Java is used to refer to the immediate superclass of child class.
-To access members os super class using super.memberName, call super class constructors using super(parameters), or invoke super class methods from within a subclass using super.methodName().
- It's first line in constructor calling. super() and this() cannot use together. 

21) Association, Aggregation, Composite
Answer: Association:
Association is a relationship between two classes that establishes a through their objects.
It can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many relationship.
Objects of one class have a reference to objects of another class, but there is no ownership or containment implied.
Example: A Driver class is associated with a Car class a Car class is associated with a Driver class through a driver instance variable. The Car class has a reference to a Driver object, but there is no ownership implied.
class Car {
    private Driver driver;

    public void setDriver(Driver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }
}

class Driver {
    // Driver class implementation
}

Aggregation:
Aggregation is a special form of association that represents a "has-a" relationship between two classes.
It implies that one class (the whole) contains or owns objects of another class (the part).
The contained objects have an independent lifecycle, and they can exist without the containing object.
Example: A Department class is aggregated with Employee class instances. a Department class aggregates Employee objects using a list. The Department "has-a" collection of Employee objects, and the Employee objects have an independent lifecycle.
class Department {
    private List<Employee> employees;

    public Department() {
        this.employees = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
        this.employees.add(employee);
    }
}

class Employee {
    // Employee class implementation
}

Composition:
Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the contained objects are part of the containing object's lifecycle.
It represents a "owns-a" relationship, where the contained objects cannot exist without the containing object.
When the containing object is destroyed, all contained objects are also destroyed.
Example: A House class is composed of Room class instances. a House class is composed of a Room class instance. The House "owns" the Room, and the Room cannot exist without the House. When the House is destroyed, the Room is also destroyed.
class House {
    private Room room;

    public House() {
        this.room = new Room();
    }
}

class Room {
    // Room class implementation
}

22) InstanceOf operator
Answer: The instanceof operator in Java is used to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class or interface. It returns true if the object is an instance of the specified type, otherwise it returns false. If object is null then return false.

Upcasting: Upcasting allows you to hold an object of a subclass in a reference variable of its superclass type.
Downcasting: Downcasting allows you to cast an object from a superclass type to a subclass type. It allows you to hold an object of a subclass in a reference variable of its superclass type. 
Downcasting can potentially throw a ClassCastException at runtime if the object being referenced is not actually an instance of the subclass. To avoid ClassCastException, it is recommended to use the instanceof operator before performing downcasting.

23) Abstract Class
Answer: Abstract class is used for achieve abstraction but not 100% becuase it's also contains concrete method. An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is typically used as a blueprint for other classes.
Declaration: An abstract class is declared using the abstract keyword in its class definition.

Key Points:
An abstract class may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by its subclasses.
It may also contain concrete methods (methods with a body) that provide default behavior to its subclasses.
An abstract class can have instance variables, constructors, static methods, and other members like any other class.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated using the new keyword because they may contain abstract methods without a body.
Subclasses of an abstract class must implement all abstract methods or be declared as abstract themselves.

Instantiation: You cannot directly create an object of an abstract class using the new keyword. However, you can create references of an abstract class type.

Constructor: An abstract class can have constructors, which are used to initialize instance variables and perform other initialization tasks. However, since abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, their constructors are typically used by subclasses during object creation through constructor chaining.

24) Interface
Answer:  used to achieve abstraction 100%. An interface in Java is a reference type that defines a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
Declaration: An interface is declared using the interface keyword followed by the interface name and a code block containing method declarations. Method declarations in interfaces are by default public and abstract. They cannot be declared as final, or native.
Interface variables are implicitly public, static, and final, meaning they are constants and cannot be modified by implementing classes. They must be initialized when declared, and their values cannot be changed. It doesn't have any constructor.
- It Support Multiple Inheritence. 
- We Can also achieve loose coupling.

For Classes -> implements keyword   For Interfaces -> extends keyword

Java 8 Changes:
Default method:
Default methods were introduced in Java to address the issue of evolving interfaces without breaking existing implementations. Prior to Java 8, adding a new method to an existing interface would require modifying all implementing classes to provide an implementation for the new method, which could be impractical or lead to a significant amount of code changes.

By introducing default methods in Java 8, interfaces can now provide default implementations for methods. This means that implementing classes automatically inherit the default implementation, but they have the option to override it if needed. Default methods allow interfaces to evolve over time by adding new methods without requiring changes to existing implementing classes.

Default methods are particularly useful for extending existing interfaces in backward-compatible ways, providing new functionality without breaking existing code. They also enable the creation of more flexible and expressive APIs, promoting code reuse and maintainability. Overall, default methods enhance the flexibility and evolution of interfaces in Java.
These methods have the default keyword.

Example:
interface MyInterface {
    // Default method
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default method in MyInterface");
    }
}
class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    // Implementing class
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of MyClass
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        
        // Call the default method
        obj.defaultMethod(); // Output: Default method in MyInterface
    }
}

Static method:
Static methods in Java interfaces were introduced to provide utility methods that are not tied to any specific instance of the interface. They allow for code organization, encapsulation of common functionality, code reusability, and convenient access to utility methods related to the interface.

Example:
interface MyInterface {
    // Static method
    static void myStaticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method in MyInterface");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Call the static method using the interface name
        MyInterface.myStaticMethod(); // Output: Static method in MyInterface
    }
}

Java 9 Changes:
Private Method: 
Private methods in Java interfaces were introduced to encapsulate common functionality within interfaces, promoting code reuse and modularity. They are declared using the private modifier and can only be accessed within the interface itself, enhancing encapsulation and hiding implementation details.

Example:
interface MyInterface {
    default void myDefaultMethod() {
        // Call private helper method
        int result = calculate(5);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }    
    private int calculate(int value) {
        // Private helper method
        return value * 2;
    }
}

25) How would you handle a situation where a class implements two interfaces, each of which declares a default method with the same signature?
Answer: 
if a class implements two interfaces that both have a default method with the same signature, the implementing class must provide its own implementation for that method to resolve the conflict. If the implementing class wants to use the default implementation from one of the interfaces, it can explicitly call that interface's default method using the interface name followed by the super keyword.

Example:
interface Interface1 {
    default void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default method from Interface1");
    }
}

interface Interface2 {
    default void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default method from Interface2");
    }
}

class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
    // Provide implementation for myMethod to resolve the conflict
    @Override
    public void myMethod() {
        // Call the default method from Interface1
        Interface1.super.myMethod();
        // Interface2.super.myMethod();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.myMethod(); // Output: Default method from Interface1
    }
}

26) Method Hiding
Answer: Method hiding in Java occurs when a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in its superclass. This hides the superclass method, effectively preventing it from being overridden in subclasses.

27) Is it possible to call a static method using an object reference in Java?
Answer : Yes, static methods can be called using an object reference in Java, but it is considered bad practice and can be confusing because static methods belong to the class itself, not to individual instances of the class.

28) Serialization and Desearilization
Answer:
Serialization / Marshalling: Serialization is the process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes that can be easily stored, transmitted, or persisted. In Java, serialization is achieved by implementing the Serializable interface. This interface does not contain any methods; it serves as a marker interface to indicate that the objects of the implementing class can be serialized.
-- Use ObjectOutputStream to write objects state to an output stream. The writeObject() method of ObjectOutputStream to serialize the object.

Deserialization / De-Marshalling: Deserialization is the process of reconstructing an object from the byte stream created during serialization. In Java, deserialization is achieved using the ObjectInputStream class, which reads bytes from an input stream and reconstructs the object from those bytes. The readObject() method of ObjectInputStream to deserialize the object.

29) Transient keyword
Answer :  The transient keyword is used to mark a field as non-serializable or it will never serialized data & save the state. When an object is serialized, fields marked as transient are not included in the serialization process. This is commonly used for sensitive data or non-essential fields that do not need to be persisted.

At the time of deserialization transient fields will be initialized with their default values (e.g., null for reference types, 0 for numeric types).

Static Field --> static fields are not serialized when an object is serialized. because it belongs to class not to any indivisual instance.
Static fields in Java are initialized when the class is loaded into memory, and their values are not saved or restored during serialization or deserialization. Therefore, when an object is deserialized, static fields will retain the values that were assigned to them when the class was loaded into memory. If no value was explicitly assigned, static fields will have their default values (e.g., 0 for numeric types, null for reference types).

static transient --> together the static keyword will govern the the behaviour of variable. so no use of transient.

final Field --> When an object is serialized, only the object's state (non-transient fields) is serialized, and final variables are considered part of the object's state. However, the value of a final variable is included in the serialized object only if it was assigned a value before serialization.

transient final : final variables are directly serialized by their values, so there is no use/impact of declaring final variable as transient.

30) Use of serialVersionUID?
Answer : The serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for a serializable class. It is a special static field that serves as a version control mechanism to ensure that the serialized and deserialized objects are compatible in terms of their class definition.

Here's how serialVersionUID is used:
Versioning: When an object is serialized, the serialVersionUID is also written to the serialized data. During deserialization, the JVM compares the serialVersionUID of the serialized object with the serialVersionUID of the locally loaded class. If they match, deserialization proceeds successfully; otherwise, an InvalidClassException is thrown.

Compatibility: If changes are made to the class definition (e.g., adding or removing fields or methods) after objects have been serialized, the serialVersionUID can be explicitly declared to maintain compatibility with previously serialized objects. By specifying a serialVersionUID, you can control the versioning of your serialized objects and ensure that they can be deserialized correctly.

Here's what happens if you don't provide a serialVersionUID:
If you don't explicitly provide a serialVersionUID in a serializable class, Java will automatically generate one based on the class definition, including its fields, methods, and other aspects. This auto-generated serialVersionUID is based on the structure of the class, and it can change if the class definition changes.
Compatibility Issues: If the class definition changes between serialization and deserialization (e.g., fields are added, removed, or modified), the automatically generated serialVersionUID may change. This can result in compatibility issues when attempting to deserialize objects serialized with an older version of the class. It leads to throw an execption InvalidClassException.

31) Exception handling
Answer: Exception handling in Java is a mechanism used to handle runtime errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during the execution of a program. 
Exception is a condition that occurs during the program execution and lead to program termination abnormally.
Using Exception Handling we can avoid program termination & continue the execution skipping execption ccode.

Exception Hierarchy: Java provides a hierarchy of exception classes, with Throwable as the root class. Exceptions are categorized into two main types: Error (unrecoverable system errors) and Exception (recoverable application errors).

Exception Types:
Error: An Error in Java represents serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. They are typically external to the application, such as system errors or internal JVM failures, and are not meant to be caught or handled by regular application code. Handling errors in Java is not recommended.

Checked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. This means that the compiler ensures that they are either caught and handled using a try-catch block, or declared in the method's signature using the throws keyword. Examples IOException, SQLException, and ClassNotFoundException.

Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions): These are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. They can occur at runtime and do not need to be explicitly caught or declared. Examples NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and ArithmeticException. We can handle using try and catch block.

Try Block: This block encloses the code that may throw an exception. It is followed by one or more catch blocks.
Catch Block: Each catch block is used to handle a specific type of exception. It contains the code that executes when the corresponding exception is thrown. more than one catch block present. catch should be ordered in the form of most specific to most general Exception. otherwise Compiler Error.
Finally Block: This block is optional and is used to execute cleanup code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught.
-- in Java, a try block can be used without a corresponding catch block if it is followed by a finally block.

Finally Block not executed in below cases:
The program exits via System.exit().
The code enters an infinite loop or encounters a deadlock.
The thread executing the try block is interrupted before reaching the finally block.

throw: The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a method.
throws: The throws keyword is used in the method signature to declare that a method may throw a particular type of exception. It specifies the types of exceptions that a method can potentially throw, but it does not handle the exceptions itself. Instead, it indicates that the method will not handle the exceptions locally and will propagate them to its caller.

Exception Propagation: if an exception occurs within a method and is not handled locally (i.e., with a try-catch block), the exception is propagated to the calling method. This propagation continues up the call stack until the exception is either caught and handled by a try-catch block or until it reaches the top-level of the program.
If the exception is not caught and handled by any method along the call stack, it will eventually reach the default exception handler provided by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In this case, the default handler typically prints the exception stack trace and terminates the program.

Java 7: introduced multi-catch exception handling, allowing a single catch block to handle multiple types of exceptions simultaneously. This reduces code duplication and improves readability.

32) Try with Resources -- Automatic Resource Management 
Answer: 
Before Java 7, resource management in Java required explicit finally blocks to ensure resources were properly closed after use. This approach was error-prone and could lead to resource leaks if developers forgot to close resources in the finally block.

Example: 
public class ResourceManagementBeforeJava7 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedReader reader = null;
        try {
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"));
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                if (reader != null) {
                    reader.close();
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("Error closing reader: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}

Java 7 introduced the "try-with-resources" statement, which simplified resource management by automatically closing resources at the end of the try block, regardless of whether an exception occurred. This feature reduced boilerplate code and made resource management more concise and readable.

1) All objects managed by a try with resources statement must implement the AutoCloseable interface.
2) Multiple AutoCloseable objects can be created within Java’s try with resources block.
3) Objects declared in a try with resources statement have scope within the try block, but not the catch and finally blocks.
4) The close() method of objects declared in a try with resources block is invoked regardless of whether an exception is thrown during execution. it will be called before catch and finally block.
5) If an exception is thrown in the close() method, it may get categorized as a suppressed exception. if both the try block and the close method of the resource throw exceptions, the exception thrown by the try block takes precedence, and any exception thrown by the close method is suppressed. we can get using getSupperessed() method.
6) When resource closed it will be followed reverse order due to avoid dependency.
Throwable[] suppressedExceptions = e.getSuppressed();

Example:
public class TryWithResourcesJava7 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"));) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

Java 9 :-- You can use try block with refernce of object - Remove limitation of declaring object inside try paranthesis.
You can use Like try(br){}
